## Implementation of KBSF

I implemented KBSF, by [Baretto, Precup & Pineau](http://jmlr.org/papers/volume17/13-134/13-134.pdf). Tested it on Mountain Car, Catch and Atari. If your patience is high, it is theoretically possible to make it "work" on Catch and Atari, but my implementation not being very optimized, running this code with a lot of support vectors of high dimension will take considerable time.


See `KBSF.ipynb` for details, `main.py` for the implementation
